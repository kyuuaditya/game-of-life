This project is intentionally kept simple and accessible, using only core web technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the page.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including Flexbox for layout, `@font-face` for custom fonts, and a responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the entire simulation logic, DOM manipulation, and handling all user interactions.
